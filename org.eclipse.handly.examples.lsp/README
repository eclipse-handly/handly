LSP Example
===========

Please see the `README` file in the `org.eclipse.handly.examples` bundle
for general information regarding Handly Examples.

The LSP example (`o.e.handly.examples.lsp*`) demonstrates a Handly-based
model that can represent in a generic way any LSP-based source file.
It is built on top of Eclipse LSP4J.

For information about LSP, see

 **Implementation note.** Currently, we use symbol location range to infer
 a hierarchy for a given flat list of symbols in a text document, just as
 Eclipse LSP4E does in its `SymbolModel`. However, according to a recent
 revision of the LSP specification
 
 > The range doesn't have to denote a node range in the sense of a abstract
 > syntax tree. It can therefore not be used to re-construct a hierarchy of
 > the symbols.
 
 It appears that, for the time being, there is no protocol defined way in LSP
 for building a tree of symbols [1]. Since the approach we currently use
 clearly violates the specification, it may or may not work, depending on
 a language server implementation.
