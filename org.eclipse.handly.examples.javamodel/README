Java Model Example
==================

Please see the `README` file in the `org.eclipse.handly.examples` bundle
for general information regarding Handly Examples.

The Java model example (`o.e.handly.examples.javamodel*`) demonstrates
a Handly-based model for the Java language along the lines of the JDT's
Java model.

As one would expect from an example, the model is somewhat contrived.
In particular:

* Only classpath entries of kind CPE_SOURCE, with paths of length 1
are considered (i.e. only source folders that are direct children
of the project resource);

* Inclusion/exclusion filters are ignored -- everything is included;

* Only default output location is supported, with path of length 1;

* Initializers and local/anonymous types are not represented in the model.

Some of these constraints may be relaxed in the future (especially
based on community feedback).

There is no corresponding UI yet, only the core model and tests.
The following UI parts are expected to appear in a subsequent release:

* Example Java editor, with Handly-based reconciling and outline;

* Example Java navigator view.

It is hoped that this example is sufficiently real-world (despite
the inevitable simplifications vs. the full-fledged JDT implementation),
and will be useful to Handly adopters. Feedback is most welcome
and can be directed to the project's forum:
